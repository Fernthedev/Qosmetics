# Qosmetics

Quest Cosmetics on a whole new level!

## Building the mod yourself:
  You'll need to get the following dependencies (preferably with qpm) and put them in an extern folder in the root folder
  
  - bs-utils 0.4.0 (extern/bs-utils/)
  - beatsaber-hook 0.5.7 (extern/beatsaber-hook/)
  - codegen 0.2.2 (extern/codegen/)
  - libil2cpp (extern/libil2cpp)
  - rapidjson (extern/beatsaber-hook/rapidjson/)

  And put their .so files in the extern folder, then just run the build script
